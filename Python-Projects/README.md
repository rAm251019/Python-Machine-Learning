# Python+Machine Learning
Uber(Refer Uber Drive.ipynb,Folder:Uber Drive Analysis):  
The project is based on the trips made by Uber drivers. Different aspects of the trip are analysed by using different functions in Python.

Used different statistical measures to draw inferences of 3 different case studies
(Refer A&B Shingles.ipynb,Survey.ipynb,Wholesale.ipynb,RamKishore_SMDMProject_26012020.pdf,Folder:Advanced Statistics):  
The project involved drawing inferences from 3 case studies, namely - Wholesale Customer Data, University Survey Data & Manufacturing Shingles Data. The concepts of various measures of Descriptive Statistics, Probability and Probability Distributions and various measures of Estimation & Hypothesis Testing are used to analyse these case studies

Used Analysis of Variance and Principal Component Analysis to analyse 2 different case studies(Refer Education-Post 12th std.ipynb,Fever.ipynb,RamKishore_ASProject_01032020.pdf,Folder:Advanced Statistics):
The project involved drawing inferences from 2 case studies, namely - Fever, Education - Post 12th Standard. The concepts of Exploratory Data Analysis, Analysis of Variance and Principal Component Analysis are used to draw inferences from these case studies

Used Data Mining Techniques to analyse 2 different case studies(Refer-Bank Marketing.ipynb(Folder:Unsupervised Learning),Insurance.ipynb(Folder:Classification Techniques),Ram Kishore_DM Project_12042020.pdf):
The project involved drawing inferences from 2 case studies, namely - Bank Marketing & Insurance. The concepts of Clustering, CART, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network are used to draw inferences from these case studies. Various performance metrics have been used to validate the performance of predictions on Test & Train sets.

Gems & Holiday Package Prediction(Refer Cubic Zirconia.ipynb,Holiday Package.ipynb,RamKishore_ML_21062020.pdf,Folder:Regression Modelling):
This project is based on 2 cases studies : Gems Price Prediction and Holiday Package prediction. In the first case study, concepts of linear regression are tested and it is expected from the learner to predict the price of gems based on multiple variables to help company maximize profits. In the second case, concepts of logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis are tested. One has to predict if the customer will purchase the holiday package to target the relevant customer base

Election Exit Poll Prediction and U.S.A Presidential Speech Analysis using Machine Learning(Refer RamKishore_ML_21062020.ipynb,RamKishore_ML_21062020.pdf,Folder:ML & NLP):
This project is based on 2 case-studies: Vote Prediction and Text Analysis. The first project is to predict which party a citizen is going to vote for on the basis of their age and according to the answers given by the citizens to the questions asked in a survey conducted. The second project is based on the analysis of the inaugural U.S.A. Presidential speeches. One has to draw inferences based on the analysis done on these speeches.
