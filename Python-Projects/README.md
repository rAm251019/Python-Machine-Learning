Uber Drive.ipynb:  
The project is based on the trips made by Uber drivers. Different aspects of the trip are analysed by using different functions in Python.

A&B Shingles.ipynb,Survey.ipynb,Wholesale.ipynb:  
The project involved drawing inferences from 3 case studies, namely - Wholesale Customer Data, University Survey Data & Manufacturing Shingles Data. The concepts of various measures of Descriptive Statistics, Probability and Probability Distributions and various measures of Estimation & Hypothesis Testing are used to analyse these case studies

Education-Post 12th std.ipynb,Fever.ipynb:
The project involved drawing inferences from 2 case studies, namely - Fever, Education - Post 12th Standard. The concepts of Exploratory Data Analysis, Analysis of Variance and Principal Component Analysis are used to draw inferences from these case studies

Bank Marketing.ipynb,Insurance.ipynb:
The project involved drawing inferences from 2 case studies, namely - Bank Marketing & Insurance. The concepts of Clustering, CART, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network are used to draw inferences from these case studies. Various performance metrics have been used to validate the performance of predictions on Test & Train sets.

Cubic Zirconia.ipynb,Holiday Package.ipynb:
This project is based on 2 cases studies : Gems Price Prediction and Holiday Package prediction. In the first case study, concepts of linear regression are tested and it is expected from the learner to predict the price of gems based on multiple variables to help company maximize profits. In the second case, concepts of logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis are tested. One has to predict if the customer will purchase the holiday package to target the relevant customer base
